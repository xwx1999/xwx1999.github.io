#### Biography
Currently, I'm a master's degree candidate at Agricultural Information Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the supervision of Professor [Xiujuan Chai](https://aii.caas.cn/rcdw/gjzc/yjy/7fb2596ddfb84ba59f14e143a154513e.htm). 

My research interests include Computer Vision (CV) and its applications in agriculture, such as animal face recognition. I am also interested in AI for Science including computational biology, and the deployment and optimization of deep learning models on edge devices.

Before joining the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering and another in E-commerce from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. During this time, I was guided by Professor [Daikun Lai](https://yjsjy.uestc.edu.cn/gmis/jcsjgl/dsfc/dsgrjj/11275?yxsh=02) at the [BMI-EP Lab](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/dklai/zh_CN/index.htm), where we were engaged in developing an unsupervised algorithm for the automatic detection of high-frequency oscillations in the EEG signals of epilepsy patients. We eventually completed a paper and secured a granted patent.
